      <b>TL;DR - </b> JavaScript enthusiast that writes clean, readable and modular code.

    <p>
      I'm a professional software developer with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and
      more than {{ yearOfExperiance }} years of relevant industry experience.
      Agile, direct communication with internal stakeholders, external clients, code reviews and
      unit testing. I have in-depth experience across the entire development cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm <b>passionate</b> about <b>full stack JavaScript</b> development.
      I also have lot of experience in C# (.NET) but in recent years that part has
      been neglected in favor of JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Do you want to see my work in action?</b> Take a peek at my
      <a :href="profile.github">github</a> account, my open source projects on
      <a :href="profile.npm">npm</a> or at any of my contributions to open source projects
      which became my passion in recent time. I belive it's time to give back to community after
      all these years of using greate open source projects in every day development.
