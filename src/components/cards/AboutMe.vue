    <p>
      I'm a professional software developer with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and
      more than {{ yearOfExperiance }} years of industry experience.
      Agile, direct communication with internal stakeholders, external clients, code reviews and
      unit testing. I have in-depth experience across the entire development cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm <b>passionate</b> about <b>Full Stack JavaScript</b> development.
      Beside JavaScript I have lot of experience in C# (.NET) but in recent years that part has been neglected in favor of JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Interesting in seing my work in action?</b> Take a peek at my <a href="https://github.com/snovakovic">github</a>
      account, my open source projects on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~snovakovic">npm</a>
      or at any of my contributions to Open Source projects which become my passion in recent time.
      I belive it's time to give back to community after all these years of using greate open source projects in every day development.
